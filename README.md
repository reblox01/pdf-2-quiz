## My Contribution

For this project, I developed a comprehensive AI-powered quiz generation system that demonstrates the practical application of large language models in education. My key contributions include:

- Designed and implemented the full-stack application using Next.js and TypeScript
- Integrated Google's Gemini Pro AI model for intelligent quiz generation
- Built a responsive, accessible UI with both light and dark mode support
- Implemented multi-language support for greater accessibility
- Created an adaptive difficulty system that generates appropriate questions based on user selection
- Added interactive feedback systems and animations for better user experience
- Developed a custom PDF parsing system that works efficiently with the AI model
- Implemented proper error handling for failed uploads and generation attempts
- Optimized the application for performance and deployment on Vercel

This project showcases my ability to work with cutting-edge AI technology, create intuitive user interfaces, and build practical applications that solve real-world problems in education and learning.
